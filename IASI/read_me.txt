  There are three datasets inside the 'iasi_fs.GapexdCoeff.h5' file, which are P, C and CH.
     P: is the IASI gap channel prediction coefficients (2060 in col * 8461 in row) 
     C: is the constant of the IASI SW gap channels (2060)
     CH: has 1 values which is 2060 representing the number of gap channels in SW [2760.625~3275.0] spectral regions respectively. 
  It has to be noted that this is an preliminary coefficient file which are supposed only to be used under clearsky, ocean only and nighttime.
