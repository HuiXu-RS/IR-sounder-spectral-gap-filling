# IR-sounder-spectral-gap-filling
Spectral gaps within the IR sounder measurements impact the accuracy of inter-comparison between IR sounders and other instruments. To fill up the spectral gaps, this project develops a PCR based method to fill up the gap channels.
Currently, the NOAA SNPP/J1 Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) spectral gaps are filled with principle component regression (PCR) methods.
